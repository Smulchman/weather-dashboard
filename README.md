# weather-dashboard

This is a webpage that allows you to search for a city and see the 5 day forecast for that city.

## Description

The page has two primary elements. On the left is a search bar and a list of cities the user has searched for. On the right is the forecast for the currently active city. The forecast for a city includes the temperature, wind speed, and humidity, as well as an icon representing the weather.

## Installation

## Usage

To use the webpage, the user should first search for a city with the searchbar provided on the left side of the screen. Searching for a city will save it as an item underneath the search bar and populate the forecast section with the forecast for the searched city.
The user can continue to search for cities for as long as they please and the cities listed will persist across reloads of the page. Additionally, the user can populate the forecast section with information pertaining to any of the previously searched cities by clicking on the list element containing that city's name on the left side of the screen (where the search history is saved).
